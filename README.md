Crystals Collector

The goal is for players to add up their score to the target number.

There are four crystals on the screen. When the game starts, each crystal will be randomly assigned a value. The value changes at the start of each game.

By clicking on a crystal, the player will add a specific amount of points to their total score. The value of each crystal will remain hidden from the player, so they must pay close attention to their score!

The player wins the game by matching their total score to the target number, and they lose the game if their total score goes above the random number.
